    <i>Source: https://www.inspiredtaste.net/25882/lemon-bars-recipe/</i><br>
    Ingredients:<br>
    Shortbread Crust<br>

<ul>
   <li> 12 tablespoons (170g) salted butter, melted and cooled
    
    <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar
    
   <li> 1 teaspoon lemon zest
    
   <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    
   <li> 2 cups (260g) all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled
    </ul>
    Lemon Topping<br>
    <ul>
   <li> 1 ½ cups (300g) granulated sugar
    
   <li> 3 tablespoons (25g) all-purpose flour
    
  <li>  1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
    
   <li> 2 teaspoons lemon zest
    
   <li> 4 large eggs
    
  <li>  3/4 cup (180ml) freshly squeezed lemon juice, from 4 to 5 lemons
    
 <li>   2 tablespoons powdered sugar for sifting tops of bars
</ul>
    Steps:<br>
    Make Crust<br>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a straight-sided 13×9-inch metal baking pan with foil, leaving an overhang on two opposite sides. (This will help when removing the cooled bars from the pan.) Lightly coat the sides of the foil, but not the bottom, with non-stick cooking spray or extra melted butter to prevent the lemon topping from sticking.
<li>In a medium bowl, use a spatula to stir and press the sugar, salt, 1 teaspoon of lemon zest, and vanilla extract together until moist and fragrant. Stir in the flour and melted butter until a crumbly, stiff dough forms.

<li>Press the dough evenly into the bottom of the prepared baking pan (it may not look like enough dough at first, but it will cover the bottom nicely). Prick the dough with a fork all over to prevent air bubbles while baking.

<li>Freeze dough for 5 minutes or until firm (or refrigerate for 30 minutes).

<li>While the crust chills, position an oven rack near the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 325°F (162°C).



<li>Bake the shortbread crust until lightly golden brown and set, 25 to 30 minutes.
    </ol>
    Make Lemon Bars<br>
    <ol>
        <li>While the crust bakes, stir the sugar, flour, salt, and 2 teaspoons of lemon zest. Whisk in the eggs until smooth, then whisk in the lemon juice.

<li>Once the crust has baked, pour the lemon topping over the hot crust. Return the pan to the oven and increase the oven temperature to 350°F (177°C). Bake until the topping is set in the center and it no longer wiggles when the pan is moved, 20 to 25 minutes.

<li>Set the pan on a cooling rack and cool until the lemon bars are firm and the bottom of the pan is no longer warm, about 1 hour. (You can speed this up by placing the bars into the refrigerator once the pan is no longer hot).

<li>Once cooled, use the foil overhang to carefully lift the bars from the pan and place them on a cutting board.
    </ol>
