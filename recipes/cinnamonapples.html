    Description: Makes 4 cups<br>

    Ingredients:<br>
<ul>
  <li>  1 ¾ pounds apples, 5 to 6 small

<li>1 teaspoon lemon juice or apple cider vinegar

    <li>2 tablespoons water, plus more as needed

        <li>2 tablespoons butter or vegan butter

            <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon

                <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom, optional

                    <li>1/8 teaspoon fresh grated nutmeg, optional

                        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

                            <li>1/2 tablespoon to 1 tablespoon maple syrup, optional
</ul>
Steps:<br>
<ol>
   <li> Choose whether or not you want to peel the apples. We prefer our apples with the peel. However, for softer cinnamon apples, peel them.

    <li>Core and cut the apples into bite-size pieces, 3/4-inch to 1-inch cubes. For slices, slice the apples into 1/4-inch thick slices.

        <li>Toss the apples, lemon juice (or vinegar), and two tablespoons of water into a wide skillet over medium-high heat. Cover the skillet with a lid (or tent them with aluminum foil). Cook, covered, for 3 to 4 minutes.

            <li>Uncover the apples, and stir in the butter, cinnamon, optional spices (cardamom and nutmeg), vanilla, and maple syrup (optional).

                <li>Cook, while stirring, until the butter melts and the apples soften to your liking, 3 to 5 minutes more. For more saucy apples, stir in 2 to 3 tablespoons more water. Simmer the water until it thickens and coats the apples. Taste, and then adjust with more maple syrup.
